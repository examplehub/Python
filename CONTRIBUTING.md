2. Create an upstream remote and sync your local copy before you branch.

4. Do the work, write good commit messages, and read the `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
5. Push to your origin repository.
6. Create a new PR in GitHub.
7. Waiting to be review by the maintainers.

#### Code Style
* Please follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) Coding Style.
* Single letter variable names are old school so please avoid them unless their life only spans a few lines.
* Expand acronyms because `gcd()` is hard to understand but `greatest_common_divisor()` is not.
* Write `test unit` to test all your functions.
